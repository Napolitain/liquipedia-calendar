# liquipedia-calendar

### What is it ?

I made initially this project in Python / Flask / Redis, but eventually ran into maintenance problems.
You can look nonetheless at its repository.

Now, written in Go, and using Memcached mostly because of its free tier, the application is more maintenable and faster.
It is also a cool way to learn Go üòÅ
